MCAB001RA;RA;Coach Oleander?;
MCAB003OL;OL;He runs a butcher shop. He wants to make food out of them.;
MCAB004FO;FO;That's right. Morry's old man was a butcher! It looks like your childhood memories of the circus got all mixed up with his childhood memories of his dad's butcher shop.;
MCAB005RA;RA;My memories were bad enough. This is just gross.;
MCAB006RA;RA;Uh oh.;
MCAB007FO;FO;You'd better keep that kid out of trouble.;
MCAB008FO;FO;With your brains all scrambled like this, what happens to him, happens to you!;
MCAB009OL;OL;Ahhh! Help!;
MCAC002OL;OL;Come here, little bunny!;
MCAC005OL;OL;Don't run or else Daddy's gonna kill you.;

MCAC008OL;OL;Please, Mr. Bun!;
MCBI004RA;RA;Hey, hey. Little Oly!;
MCBI005RA;RA;It's okay, those monsters are gone now.;
MCBI009RA;RA;Who's coming?;
MCBI011RA;RA;Your dad... the butcher?;
MCBI012OL;OL;He says little bunnies are good for nothing.;
MCBI013OL;OL;Nothing but food!;
MCBI015OL;OL;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!;

MCAJ006EV;EV;Rrrarggrmble-grmble!;
MCAJ007EV;EV;What's going on here? What have you done to our circus?;
MCAJ008RA;RA;Dad!;
MCAJ009EV;EV;Polluted! Perverted! This looks like the work of MENTALISTS!;
MCAJ010RA;RA;I can explain!;
MCAJ011EV;EV;Have you been associating with PSYCHICS?;
MCAJ012RA;RA;Dad, I--;
MCAJ013EV;EV;Psychics! Fortune tellers! They killed your grandfather! They cursed our entire family to die in water!;
MCAJ014RA;RA;Yes, but--;
MCAJ015EV;EV;Including you, Razputin, and me. But I'm going to live, you know why? Because I'm still an acrobat. ;
MCAJ016EV;EV;Let's see if you are!;
MCAK000EV;EV;What's it going to be, son? Die in the water? Or show me what you got?;
MCAL001EV;EV;Let's see if you remember your training!;
MCAL002EV;EV;Quick! Up here! Before the cold clammy hand of fear pulls you under!;
MCAL003EV;EV;Razputin!;
MCAL004EV;EV;Up here!;
MCAL007EV;EV;Maybe if you spent more time practicing your acrobatics and less time reading those comic books you'd be up here by now!;
MCAL009EV;EV;Finally!;
MCAL011EV;EV;Mmm. Pretty good. BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.;
MCAL013EV;EV;Hey, son. Catch!;
MCAL016EV;EV;Think fast!;
MCAL017EV;EV;Here you go!;
MCAL018EV;EV;You used to LIKE to play catch with me!;
MCAL019EV;EV;Incoming!;
MCAL020EV;EV;Little help?;
MCAL021EV;EV;Well, just as well. One fewer psychic in the world!;
MCAM000RA;RA;Dad! I made it!;
MCAM002RA;RA;No, I used the acrobatics you taught me!;
MCAM011BU;BU;Make that GROUND. Ha ha ha.;
MCAN000GD;GD;Razputin...;
MCFU003GD;GD;What is your brain doing out here in this tank with this… other brain?;
MCFU004GD;GD;And who are all these unconscious people? ;
MCFU005GD;GD;What have you gotten yourself involved with?;
MCFU007GD;GD;Is that really...;
MCFU008GD;GD;Is that really how I look in your mind?;
MCFU010GD;GD;I don't hate psychics! I used my psychic connection with you to find you, and to project myself into your mind.;
MCFU012GD;GD;Son, I could never hate you. I only wanted you to be happy, Razputin. And safe. ;
MCFU013GD;GD;Our family has many enemies.;
MCFU016GD;GD;I have a LOT more hair than that!;
MCFU017GD;GD;Now, son, we have to carefully unweave your psyche from that other brain.;
MCFU018GD;GD;We don't want anything bad to happen while your mind is in this tangled state. The damage could be permanent.;
MCFU020BU;BU;NEVER!;
MCFU022BU;BU;And I think I can… juggle now!;
MCFU023EV;EV;Heh heh heh!;
MCFU025GD;GD;This is your mind, so YOU are the strong one here.;
MCFU026GD;GD;What I'm about to give you, my son--you must take care of it. Because it's everything I've got.;
MCVI009GD;GD;Let's go inside.;
MCVI011GD;GD;Oh, I know a lot of it. While you were out I... poked around a bit. ;
MCVI012RA;RA;You what?;
MCVI014RA;RA;Hey!;
MCAC003OL;OL;I'm not going to hurt you!;

MCAL010EV;EV;Don't stop now. The water's still rising!;
MCAL012EV;EV;Pretty good, pretty good.;
MCAL014EV;EV;Ha ha ha.;
MCAL015EV;EV;No, you can't really catch those. I was just testing ya.;
MCAM001EV;EV;You cheated!;
MCAM003EV;EV;Don't lie to me, cheater! You crystal ball readers always cheat!;
MCAM004EV;EV;You're no son of mine.;

MCFU001GD;GD;Razputin! I see your skull is as hard to penetrate as ever!;
MCFU006EV;EV;Psychics! He's been cavorting with filthy, cheating psychics!;
MCFU009EV;EV;Man, do I hate psychics, and seeing my son happy!;
MCFU011RA;RA;But how can you hate me for being psychic, if you're psychic too?;
MCFU014EV;EV;Ahhhhhh!;
MCFU015EV;EV;Ayeeeee!;
MCFU019EV;EV;Unweave? Detangle?;

MCVI005OL;OL;Bye! Bye! Wave goodbye, Mr. Bun!;
MCVI006RA;RA;Where's he going?;
MCVI007GD;GD;We're separating the brains now Razputin.;
MCVI008GD;GD;He'll be fine.;
MCVI010RA;RA;Man, I can't wait to tell you about all the messed up stuff that happened.;
MCVI013GD;GD;Tell me about this Lili person.;

MCAB012OL;OL;If he'd just hold still I could catch him and hide him from my dad.;
MCCA000OL;OL;Oh, hi. My name is Morceau Oleander. But you can call me Morry. Or Oly.;
MCCA001RA;RA;What are you doing in my mind?;
MCCA002OL;OL;How did you get in my happy meadow? Nobody's supposed to know about it.;
MCCA003OL;OL;You didn't tell my dad about it, did you?;
MCCA004BU;BU;(evil laughter);
MCCA005OL;OL;(frightened gasp);
MCCA006OL;OL;That's him! Oh no! Come on, little bunny. We'll be safe in here!;
