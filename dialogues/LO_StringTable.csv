LOVE003CO;CO;I've got the brain of a little girl back in my lab that's strong enough to power a whole army of Psychoblaster Death Tanks!;
LOVE004RA;RA;Why you--heh heh!;
LOVE005CO;CO;Wha--;

LOAB014Z1;Z1;WOOOOO!;
LOAB015Z1;Z1;FREEDO--;
LOAB109Z1;Z1;FREEDOM!;
LOCP001LC;LC;Ahhhhhhhhh!;
LOCP002LC;LC;Kochamara, save us!;
LOCP003LC;LC;Where is Kochamara?;
LOCP004LC;LC;Ah, my house!;
LOCP005LC;LC;That's my school! ... Hooray!;
LOCP006LC;LC;Heeeeelllllllp!;
LOCP007LC;LC;It's Goggalor! Run!;
LOCP008LC;LC;Please don't kill me, Goggalor!;
LOCP009LC;LC;It's Goggalor! He hates children!;
LOCP010LC;LC;Hey everyone, here comes Kochamara! No, wait, it's Goggalor. RUN!;
LOCP011LC;LC;Bullets don't hurt him!;
LOCP012LC;LC;Why, Goggalor, why?;
LOCP013LC;LC;Nothing can stop him!;
LOCP014LC;LC;Where are the police?;
LOCP015LC;LC;Go back to your watery hell, Goggalor!;
LOCP017LC;LC;I hate you, Goggalor!;
LOCP018LC;LC;Nooooooooooo! Not the natural history museum!;
LOCP019LC;LC;Oh no, Goggalor's heading for the orphanage!;
LOCP020LC;LC;It's okay everyone. Goggalor missed the orphanage!;
LOCP021LC;LC;No wait he's still heading for the orphanage!;
LOCP022LC;LC;Oh my god, the orphanage!;
LOCP023LC;LC;Hold on--that wasn't the orphanage.;
LOCP024LC;LC;Oh no, it was the orphanage--for dogs. It was the puppy orphanage everyone!;
LOCP025LC;LC;No wait--I spoke too fast.;
LOCP026LC;LC;It was just a mattress factory.;
LOCP027LC;LC;Okay, that's not too bad.;
LOCP028LC;LC;Ahhhhh, my mattress factory! I'm ruined!;
LOCP029LC;LC;I love you Goggalor!;
LOCP030LC;LC;Good lord, he's impervious to bullets and love!;
LOCP031LC;LC;Why doesn't the Navy electrocute him?;
LOCP032LC;LC;I don't want to complain, but Kochamara should do something.;
LOCP033LC;LC;Holy smokes, those goggles are five thousand meters tall!;
LOCP034LC;LC;Oh no. Ohhhhh no. Noooooooo!;
LOCP035LC;LC;You're lucky we can't own guns, Goggalor!;
LOCP036LC;LC;We've faced monsters like you before, Goggalor, only much smaller.;
LOCP037LC;LC;My car!;
LOCP038LC;LC;My bait shop!;
LOCP039LC;LC;My tank!;
LOCP040LC;LC;My cheese shop!;
LOCP041LC;LC;My outlet store!;
LOCP042LC;LC;Gahhhhhhhhh!;
LOZI001Z1;Z1;Hey! Goggalor! Down here!;
LOZI002RA;RA;Excuse me, were you talking to me?;
LOZI003Z1;Z1;Ahhhhhh! Owwwww! My ears!;
LOZI004RA;RA;I'm sorry.;
LOZI005Z1;Z1;Ahhhhhh! Oh my god! Ahhhhhhhh!;
LOZI006RA;RA;Are you okay?;
LOZI007Z2;Z2;He's dead!;
LOZI008RA;RA;Oh jeez, I'm sorry.;
LOZI009Z2;Z2;Don't worry, every member of the resistance is prepared to die fighting the tyranny of Kochamara.;
LOZI010RA;RA;What's Kochamara?;
LOZI011Z2;Z2;He's a giant monster like you, Goggalor. He brainwashed and enslaved almost everyone in Lungfishopolis.;
LOZI012RA;RA;That stinks. So hey, have you seen any other humans around here? I'm looking for a girl called Lili.;
LOZI015Z2;Z2;The government archives might have some information about your young girlfriend, Goggalor.;
LOZI016RA;RA;I don't know if she's really my girlfriend. I mean, I think she--;
LOZI017Z2;Z2;I only meant that she is your friend who is a girl, Goggalor. To access the archives, we must first destroy the broadcast tower Kochamara uses to control the populace.;
LOZI018RA;RA;Check. I'll go smash that, then.;
LOZI019Z2;Z2;Wait, Goggalor! In order to reach the tower, you'll need to pass through that wall of lasers. But you'll never make it through the lasers without our help.;
LOZI020RA;RA;So are you gonna start helping soon?;
LOZI021Z2;Z2;First, I need you to do something for the resistance. Punch a hole in that prison and free my comrades!;
LOZI025RA;RA;Hooyah! Now how about getting me past those gates?;
LOZI026Z1;Z1;Right. We stole this shield power module from Kochamara. It's too big for any of us to operate, but it should work for you.;
LOZI027RA;RA;Hey, is this gonna upset Kochamara and all your little brainwashed neighbors?;
LOZI028Z1;Z1;Nooo.;
LOZI029Z2;Z2;I doubt it.;
LOZI030Z3;Z3;Uh, no no no.;
LOZI031RA;RA;So knocking down the prison and then breaking this laser shield thing--nobody's gonna get mad about that and start shooting at me?;
LOZI032Z1;Z1;Nooooo!;
LOZI033Z2;Z2;Uhh, maybe one guy would.;
LOZI034Z1;Z1;But what is even an entire navy of Lungfish against the might and revolutionary zeal of Goggalor!;
LOZI035RA;RA;Wait, what Navy?;
LOZI036Z1;Z1;Meet us at the dam, Goggalor. FOR FREEDOM!;
LOZM003Z1;Z1;Goggalor, come in! We have commandeered these vessels in your name!;
LOZM004Z2;Z2;We can put them in position to help you cross Kochamara Channel, to get to Kochamara Island, and destroy Kochamara Tower!;
LOZM005Z1;Z1;The thing is that, uh, although you have had SEVERAL excellent plans today, Goggalor... We... Uh…;
LOZM006Z2;Z2;Er, we just think it best, uh... to... er… uh…;
LOZM007Z1;Z1;We've decided to maintain our position out here.;
LOZM008Z2;Z2;Just until you clear the area of all hostiles.;
LOZM009Z1;Z1;Yes.;
LOZM010Z2;Z2;For insurance reasons, Goggalor.;
LOZM011Z1;Z1;Yes! That, and for Freedom!;
LOZJ001TO;TO;Terror in Lungfishopolis;
LOAA001CO;CO;The peaceful city of Lungfishopolis is under attack tonight by a hideous, gigantic monster the terrified citizens have named, "Goggalor.";
LOAA002CO;CO;The navy has responded quickly and decisively, dispatching its entire tank division to neutralize the creature.;
LOAA003CO;CO;Soon, authorities say, everything will return to normal or better.;
LOAA004CO;CO;(Kidnapping human children is good.);
LOZJ000TO;TO;Goggalor: On Drugs?;
LOAD001CO;CO;Well, things have gotten a little embarrassing for Goggalor. Recently surfaced information has strongly linked the previously intimidating monster with common lowlife criminals.;
LOAD002CO;CO;Earlier tonight, Goggalor broke some of his jailhouse cronies out of the slammer so they could enjoy a night on the town, popping pills, and soliciting inexpensive call girls.;
LOAD003CO;CO;Well, they're in for one nasty hangover! Our beloved Navy has come up with a high-tech new invention: trucks armed with HYPER-ELECTRICITY!!!;
LOAD004CO;CO;(When kidnapping children, do not harm the brains.);
LOZJ002TO;TO;No Quarter from Goggalor;
LOAE001CO;CO;The destruction and terror continue as the hulking, godless child-beast carves a bloody swath through our helpless city.;
LOAE002CO;CO;Our noble, all-volunteer Navy has been surprised only by the senseless lust for mayhem that seeps from the twisted, black lump of a heart in this creature, still known only as Goggalor.;
LOAE003CO;CO;Though it loathes violence in all its forms, the Navy has no choice but to activate its Anti-Monster Turrets, which it guarantees are 100% monster proof.;
LOAE004CO;CO;(Do not get caught stealing children.);
LOZJ003TO;TO;Famous Child Star Hates Goggalor;
LOAF001CO;CO;We're here with the star of the popular sitcom, "Trouble in the Bubble," Buddy Finn. ;
LOAF002CO;CO;Buddy, what's your take on the Goggalor situation? Is he just misunderstood? ;
LOAF003CO;CO;No way! I hate Goggalor! I can't imagine any one of my fans siding with the monster. He hates everything Lungfish care about--;
LOAF004CO;CO;Air, water, family, the economy...;
LOAF005CO;CO;Buddy, you'll be happy to know that the Navy has decided to pull out what they're most famous for: ;
LOAF007CO;CO;So, rest assured, we can all look forward to Goggalor's imminent death, and to seeing you, Buddy, every Thursday night at eight, right here on LBC!;
LOAF008CO;CO;Thanks, and I'd just like to add that if anyone kidnaps a human child they should take them quickly under the lake to the abandoned insane asylum.;
LOZJ004TO;TO;The End is Nigh;
LOAG001CO;CO;Well, we're sorry to report that the miserable and incompetent Lungfish Navy is all but sunk.;
LOAG002CO;CO;Great work, losers!;
LOAG003CO;CO;Now Kochamara himself will have to come all the way down here just to save our worthless hides. ;
LOAG004CO;CO;Authorities are calling for a big parade in Kochamara's honor after he clobbers the annoying giant Goggalor, and if the parade is big enough, Kochamara promises NOT to destroy the city.;
LOAG005CO;CO;(Brush teeth more often. Don't drool so much.);
LOAH000Z1;Z1;Goggalor, what are you doing down here?;
LOAH001RA;RA;I'm trying to get to that Kochamara Tower thing so I can smash it.;
LOAH002Z1;Z1;The laser tunnel, Goggalor. We have to get through that or we'll never get to Kochamara Island!;
LOAH003RA;RA;But I thought--;
LOAH004Z1;Z1;There is no "I" in team, Goggalor!;
LOAH005RA;RA;Yeah, but there's an "I" in "squish" so watch it.;
LOAH006RA;RA;I'll go take out your laser tunnel, but then we're going to talk about who's running this revolution.;
LOAI000Z1;Z1;Goggalor! Another jail to smash! Take it out and free the prisoners, Goggalor!;
LOAI002Z4;Z4;So this big monster, is that the best you could do?;
LOAI003Z1;Z1;We were short on time, and he is good at smashing things!;
LOAI004Z4;Z4;Doesn't look like much to me. Come on, let's blow this joint.;
LOAI005RA;RA;Hey, you're welcome!;
LOAI006Z1;Z1;Sorry about him, Goggalor. He's been in prison a long time.;
LOAI007Z1;Z1;He's the only pilot the resistance has, and he has an excellent plan! ;
LOAI008Z1;Z1;Meet us at the dam so we can put it into action!;
LOAI009Z1;Z1;Ha! Now you see the genius of our plan, Goggalor!;
LOAI010Z4;Z4;First, we print flyers. Then we spread them all over town with my blimp!;
LOAI011Z1;Z1;Winning over the hearts and minds of Lungfishopolis in as soon as six months.;
LOAI012RA;RA;Six months?;
LOAI013Z4;Z4;You don't like our plan, you can come up with another one!;
LOAI014Z1;Z1;Yes, we are busy! We have to select card stock, and then find a decent, but inexpensive printer within the week.;
LOAI015Z4;Z4;Hey, what are you doing up there?;
LOAI016Z4;Z4;Ow!;
LOAI017Z4;Z4;Hey!;
LOAI018Z1;Z1;Careful! My chai tea!;
LOAI019Z4;Z4;Quit it!;
LOAI020Z4;Z4;Knock it off!;
LOAI021Z4;Z4;We don't have a replacement blimp, you know!;
LOAI022RA;RA;Have you come up with a better plan than the pamphlets yet?;
LOAI023Z4;Z4;Yes, it's called "Turn in Goggalor for Reward Money.";
LOAI024RA;RA;Hey, you guys still in there? It's Goggalor!;
LOAI025Z4;Z4;Oh, this guy. Just ignore him. He'll go away. ;
LOZN000Z1;Z1;The thing is that, uh, although we have the utmost faith that you will soon contain the area, Goggalor… we... uh…;
LOAJ000CO;CO;Give up while you can, Goggalor!;
LOAJ001RA;RA;I know it's you in there, Coach! I don't know where you're broadcasting from, but I'm going to find out and make you show me what happened to Lili.;
LOAJ002CO;CO;Kochamara does not speak giant monster boy language.;
LOAJ003RA;RA;The only word you're going to need is "Ouch.";
LOAJ004CO;CO;Miiiiiiiiiiightyyyyyyyyyyyyy... ;
LOAJ005CO;CO;RAM!;
LOAJ006CO;CO;Deeeeeeaaaadlyyyyyyyyy...;
LOAJ007CO;CO;TRIANGLE BEAM!;
LOAJ008CO;CO;Hmm. So Sasha's showed you how to save up your aggressive energy, huh?;
LOAJ009CO;CO;Well, why don't I help you…;
LOAJ010CO;CO;Let it all out!;
LOAJ011CO;CO;Bwah ha ha!;
LOAJ012CO;CO;Whaddya going to do now, eh?;
LOAJ013CO;CO;Oh no! No ammo!;
LOAJ014CO;CO;I'm lost without my ammo!;
LOAJ015CO;CO;I'm nothing without my cheater PSI Blast!;
LOAJ016CO;CO;Oh, Sasha, Sasha. Come help me.;
LOAJ017CO;CO;I have no defenses of my own!;
LOAJ018CO;CO;Miiiiightyyy Raaaaam...;
LOAJ019CO;CO;GROUND VERSION!;
LOAJ020CO;CO;Speeeeee-deeeeeee...;
LOAJ021CO;CO;KICK!;
LOAJ022CO;CO;Ooooverrrrrlyyyyy Innnnn-triiiiii-cate…;
LOAJ024CO;CO;Haaaarrrrrrd tooooo aaaaavoooid…;
LOAJ025CO;CO;...aaaaavoooid...;
LOAJ026CO;CO;AREA ATTACK!;
LOAJ027CO;CO;Woooooo-hoooooo!;
LOAJ028CO;CO;MMmm-hmmm.;
LOAJ029CO;CO;Feel the burn!;
LOAJ030CO;CO;Ha!;
LOAJ031CO;CO;Huhhh!;
LOAJ032CO;CO;Hup!;
LOAJ033CO;CO;Hyaaa!;
LOAJ034CO;CO;Hap!;
LOAJ035CO;CO;Hop!;
LOAJ036CO;CO;Hayooo!;
LOAJ037CO;CO;Waaaaaaah!;
LOAJ038CO;CO;And this!;
LOAJ039CO;CO;And that!;
LOAJ040CO;CO;And backwards!;
LOAJ041CO;CO;And faked you out!;
LOAJ042CO;CO;Ha ha!;
LOAJ043CO;CO;Ho ho!;
LOAJ044CO;CO;Heh heh heh!;
LOAJ045CO;CO;Ahhh!;
LOAJ046CO;CO;Oooff!;
LOAJ047CO;CO;Gahhh!;
LOAJ048CO;CO;(electrocution sounds);
LOAJ049CO;CO;Grrr!;
LOAJ050RA;RA;Give up Coach. I'm sure the Psychonauts are on their way from HQ right now to bust you.;
LOAJ051CO;CO;Sorry, but I was made senior facility officer this year, and the senior facility officer has notified HQ that everything is peachy at Camp Whispering Rock!;
LOAK000CO;CO;People of Lungfishopolis...;
LOAK001CO;CO;...I'm sorry I let you down.;
LOAK002CO;CO;Ggggghhh..;
LOAK003RA;RA;Finally!;
LOAK004RA;RA;Okay, tower. Get ready for Goggalor!;
LOAK005Z1;Z1;Goggalor, you did it! You defeated Kochamara!;
LOAK006RA;RA;Yep. Now we can find out where Lili went.;
LOAK007Z1;Z1;Not yet. The tower is still broadcasting its mind control over the populace!;
LOAK008Z1;Z1;You must destroy the tower!;
LOAK009RA;RA;Right. Man, Goggalor needs a sidekick or a PA or something.;
LOAK010Z1;Z1;Goggalor! The tower!;
LOAK011RA;RA;Oh! Yeah! Right.;
LOAL000RA;RA;Well, he was evil. But he did build a lot of roads.;
LOAM000Z1;Z1;Goggalor! ;
LOAM001RA;RA;Hey, shouldn't this place be much quieter now that Kochamara's gone?;
LOAM002Z1;Z1;Well, there's still some crazy Navy guys who haven't realized that the war is over. But--we got 'em on the run I think.;
LOAM003Z1;Z1;Got some really aggressive flyers at the printer right now. Should sway popular opinion our way in no time.;
LOAM004RA;RA;So you don't mind if I smash up some more tanks and planes and stuff?;
LOAM005Z1;Z1;Goggalor, you may smash it all! This whole area is scheduled for reforestation. ;
LOAM006Z1;Z1;Kochamara built this city for us. Lungfish weren't meant to live in cities!;
LOAM007RA;RA;Well, okay then. I'll bet I can save you a bit on the demolition costs.;
LOAM008Z1;Z1;Yeah, go nuts! You can squish people too if you want. My family lives in a whole other town.;
LOZF000TO;TO;/YButton/ Pick up Tank.;
LOZE000TO;TO;/YButton/ Throw Tank.;
LOUC001LC;LC;Hey everyone, here comes Kochamara!;
LOZF001TO;TO;Use your PSYCHIC SHIELD to protect you from damage, and reflect SOME enemy attacks back at the attacker! NOTE: You will not be able to maintain a PSYCHIC SHIELD forever, and when this part of your mind is exhausted, you will need to wait a while before you use it again.;
LOAO000RA;RA;Excellent. There it is.;
